THzTools Documentation
====================================

**Date**: |today| **Version**: |version|

THzTools is an open-source Python package for data analysis in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy
(THz-TDS). As the name suggests, THz-TDS involves measurements of terahertz-frequency
electromagnetic waveforms that are acquired as a function of *time*, which users typically
represent as a function of *frequency* for analysis. THzTools makes it easier for researchers
to use statistically optimal methods for doing this analysis, as described in Laleh Mohtashemi
et al., Opt. Express **29**, 4912 (2021), `<https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.417724>`_.
