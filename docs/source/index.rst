**THzTools** is a Python package of data analysis tools for terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.
As the name suggests, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy involves measurements of
terahertz-frequency electromagnetic waveforms that are acquired as a function of *time*.
A variety of methods exist to transform these measurements into functions of *frequency*,
but the standard procedures have several pitfalls. **THzTools** includes procedures that
make it easier for researchers to avoid these pitfalls and use the best available
methods for analyzing their data. Some of the methods included in the package were described
previously in the paper at this `link <https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.417724>`_.
