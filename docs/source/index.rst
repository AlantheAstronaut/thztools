THzTools is an open-source Python package for data analysis in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy
(THz-TDS). As the name suggests, THz-TDS involves measurements of terahertz-frequency
electromagnetic waveforms that are acquired as a function of *time*, which users typically
represent as a function of *frequency* for analysis. THzTools makes it easier for researchers
to use statistically optimal methods for doing this analysis, as described in |thz-tds-mle|_.
