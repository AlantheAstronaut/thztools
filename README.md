# Data analysis tools for terahertz time-domain spectroscopy

Project to compute estimates for noise model parameters and transfer function parameters.

## Installation

This project is based on the Cookiecutter Data Science [template](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science). See [here](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) for documentation.

1. Make sure you create and activate a virtual environment for development with `thztools`. Instructions for doing this with `conda` are available [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

2. Use `pip` to install the `thztools` package in the primary directory. Note that the period (`.`) indicates the current directory.
```
pip install -e .
