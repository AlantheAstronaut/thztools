Starting parallel pool (parpool) using the 'local' profile ...
Connected to the parallel pool (number of workers: 12).
Warning: Some components of the tuned mass vector were negative. These components were set to 0.001. Consider choosing a different starting point when tuning parameters (e.g., the MAP point).
