Folder `2017-03-20/Airscans` includes three folders:

**Normal** : Air scans that are acquired under normal normal condition

**Reduced 1**: Air scans that are acquired when the amplitude of the pulse is reduced by 30%.

Reduction is due to reducing the driving voltage of the generator. 

**Reduced 2**: Air scans that are acquired when the amplitude of the pulse is reduced by 60%.

Reduction is due reducing the driving voltage of the generator.
